# API Terms of Service

In order to use the Packt API, you agree to:

Abide by our general Terms and Conditions [https://www.packtpub.com/about/terms-and-conditions] of use and the following additional terms governing the use of our API:

* Not try to circumvent our rate limiting. Packt tracks all requests made by developers.

* Clearly display the Packt name or logo on any location where Packt data appears. For instance if you are displaying a Packt product, you should clearly label this as "by Packt Publishing"

* Not use the API to harvest or index Packt data without our explicit written consent.

* You may store information obtained from the Packt API,, but need to refresh this data regularly (at least once a week). Packt needs the ability to modify, remove, and update the order of our data, which caching would prevent. 

* Not sublicense or redistribute Packt data to any 3rd parties without our explicit written consent.

* Not modify or change Packt data in any way. Data may be truncated for display purposes.

* Not use the Packt API data as part of a commercial product without our explicit written consent. If you would like to include Packt data in a commercial product, please contact us.

* Not name your application "Packt". Do not use "Packt" in your applications name. You may use the Packt logo to acknowledge your apps association with Packt, but not as the main logo for or within your app.

* Acknowledge that your developer account can be suspended for any infraction of these terms.

* Acknowledge that these terms may be updated or amended at any time without prior notice, and that your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
