# Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the Packt API?**

Put simply, APIs allow two or more systems to share data with each other, giving you new ways to consume and interact with Packt systems and data.  Our API's are real-time and centralize data from multiple Packt systems. 

You're likely to interact with APIs on a regular basis, however we do encourage to you to cache the data you receive from us. 

The REST API follows JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) standards for formatting sent and received data. A principal advantage of JSON is that it helps make API queries easy to write, read, and parse by developers and machines.

**Is there a way to integrate with you without using the API?**

We currently provide key partners bespoke feeds with our data, however over time we will be moving towards this standardised API. 

Our core design philosophy around our API is to make it as easy as possible for you to work with.

That said, if you have specific requirements please do contact our Partners team who will be more than happy to support you.

**Are there any limits on using the API?**

We do limit the amount of calls you make on our API, see [our Rate Limit](/docs/ratelimiting) documentation for details. If you want to go faster, please do contact our Partners team who can support your request.

Your use of data is limited by the restrictions set out in our [Terms of Use](/docs/terms). 

**I'm using a third-party service/wrapper and it is not working. Can you help?**

Unfortunately, we do not offer support for third-party services or tools. Please reach out to the service  for further assistance.

In addition, it is a security risk to enter your Packt API Token Key(s) into any third-party platform. Use these services at your own discretion.

**Despite making no changes, I'm suddenly receiving errors. What happened?**

We frequently update our API, but aim to make non-breaking changes or create new versions of the API if the API changes drastically.

In any case, please let us know through the support form and we will investigate this together.

**Am I able to do *this* or *that* with the API?**

If you do not see the functionality you are requesting in our documentation, you should assume that we do not provide it currently. 

Please do make a feature suggestion through our support form with your suggestion and we will review this as soon as we can.

**I believe there is an issue with the API. How should I report it?**

If you feel there is an issue with the system and not with your implementation, please provide do share with us your code and any output through our support portal, and we will investigate as soon as we can.

Please do share as much as you can, as vague messages/errors will make it harder for us to reproduce the error you are seeing. 

**Can you help us with the coding?**

Maybe, though it is not considered part of the normal on boarding process. We are happy to answer questions and provide sample code, however if you require extensive coding the Partner team would need to discuss your needs. 

**Can anyone use the API?**

Yes, however you will only have access to our product information service, in order to use the other end points you will need to connect with our Partners team who will be happy to help you.
